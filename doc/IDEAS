Ctrl+Enter should mean to jump immediately with the current settings
   (wo further autocompletion)

The current target URL should always be visible.

Area under logo where you can conveniently paste URLs into.

Autocomplete
	extra label

History management
	university way: express state explicitly so it can be saved/restored
	easy way (will this work?):
	     - every widget appends it state (name=value,selbegin,selend) to the url when
	        - losing focus
		- no user input for 100ms
		- jumping to URL
	     - restore time we just synthesize user input from the URL
	     - when autocomplete extra label gets implemented, we
               should remember and restore both values (selected,
               autocompleted)

	either way, we will need access to text selection in
	inputboxes (tested with firefox and chrome):
	       $("#user")[0].selectionStart
	       $("#user")[0].selectionEnd
	       $("#user")[0].setSelectionRange(1, 10)
