rocks:
 - us :-)
 - mass editing of bookmarks/tags/urls in an editor
 - keyword bookmarks with autocomplete and multiple fields

sucks:
 - binary (sql!) bookmarks
 - oneliner javascript keyword bookmarks to split multiple params
 - bookmark synchronization (between different vendors?)
 - firefox/chrome profiles (e.g. multi machine)
